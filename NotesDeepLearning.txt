Supervised Classification:

Ranking:

Softmax:

np.exp(x)/np.sum(np.exp(x),axis=1)


If you increase the size of your output i.e. if you multiply with a positive number greater than 1 your classifier becomes more confident

instead if you decrease the size of your output it becomes unsure.

One hot encoding:

cross entropy:
